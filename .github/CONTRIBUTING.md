# [Contributing]()

There are many ways in which you can contribute to this dataset.
Data patches are just one thing amongst others that you can submit to help the
project. We also welcome feedback, bug reports, feature data requests, documentation 
improvements, advocating, data testing and many different things. 
Just talk to us if you want to help, and we will help you help us. 

## [Feedback]()

This is by far the easiest way to contribute something. If you're using
this dataset for your own project, don't hesitate sharing. It's just incredibly motivating to know that people use the things you develop. If you have something that
you would like to tell us. Screenshots and videos are also very welcome!


We're also interested in the problems you had when getting started. Please
feel encouraged to report any obstacles you encountered such as missing
documentation, misleading directions or similar.
We are perfectionists, so even if it's just a typo, let us know.

## [Reporting an Issue]()

If you have any problems, a crash, a segfault, missing documentation, invalid
spelling, weird examples, please take 2 minutes to report the issue and follow
the guide lines mentioned [here.]()

## [Code Contributions]()

Data and code contributions (patches, new features) are the most obvious way to help with
the project's development. Since this is quite common, we ask you to follow our
workflow to most efficiently work with us. Adhering to our workflow ensures that
your contribution won't be forgotten or lost. Also, your name will always be
associated with the change you made, which basically means eternal fame in our
code history (you can opt-out if you don't want that).


* [Coding style]()
* [Performance]()
* [Git & GitHub]()
* [Code Workflow]()

## [Documentation Contributions]()

Documentation contributions generally follow the same workflow as code
contributions, just a bit more lax. We don't ask you to go through all the
hassle just to correct a single typo. For more complex contributions, please
follow the suggested workflow.


* [Docstrings]()
